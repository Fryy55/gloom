# GLOOM - OpenGL Object Oriented Monstrosity
i originally was gonna call it GLOW but omg it already exists for the same purpose!! so i became **gloom**y and called it this. anyway it's here just so i can work with my things more easily and for fun, no one is really supposed to use it but if you _really_ want to - yw

## Features:
- **no docs**!!! you either go by the source code or by instinct! no doxygen either lmao
- **no updates**!!! i only add stuff i myself need gg
- **limited setup**!!! it's based on [GLAD1](https://glad.dav1d.de/) and [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) because i follow [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) and felt like normal FP approach of these libs is super C piled and overall sucks

## License
MIT, shrimple as that. in fact idrc you can do whatever with this code, this repo is just for versioning of my thing and is not really supposed to be a full product
